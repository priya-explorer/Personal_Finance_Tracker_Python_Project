# Finance Tracker

## Objective: To find personal financial budget at the end of the month.

In our daily life, we all maintain our own personal expenses. At times, it is common that we lose track of our expenses and run out of budget. So, we need a way to keep up with our budget. To overcome this we can use our skills in Python to create a program that will allow us to keep track of our finance expenses. So, with the help of the program created, users can easily set a budget and add up their expenses to make better financial decisions.
