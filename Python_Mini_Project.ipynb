    "In our daily life, we all maintain our own personal expenses.At times, it is common that we lose track of our expenses and run out of budget. So, we need a way to keep up with our budget. To overcome this we can use our skills in Python to create a program that will allow us to keep track of our finance expenses. So, with the help of the program created, users can easily set a budget and add up their expenses to make better financial decisions. \n",
